1
00:01:37,898 --> 00:01:41,744
<i>Back then, not sleeping,
I'd la y awake thinking about women.</i>

2
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:44,647
<i>My daughter, my wife.</i>

3
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:47,911
I mean, it's like

4
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:51,618
somethings just got your name on it,
like a bullet

5
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:54,289
or a nail in the road.

6
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,630
Shit. Sorry. I drift.

7
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:04,897
Sometimes when I've had a few of this.

8
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:09,433
That's why I like to drink alone.
One reason, anyway.

9
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:13,302
- About that sculpture thing.
- Hmm.

10
00:02:14,835 --> 00:02:18,078
Kind of strange it turns up like that,
years later.

11
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:21,575
Yeah, nobody knew
why that thing was in the playhouse.

12
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:31,592
<i>I mean, the aunt reckoned maybe it was
something she made in school, you know.</i>

13
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:39,770
<i>To me, it was like someone
was having a conversation, you know.</i>

14
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:50,775
Girl's school shut down in '92,
closed down after Andrew.

15
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:54,781
That mean anything to you?

16
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:04,495
Oh, we notified the deceased's mother.

17
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:11,825
<i>Do you remember the last time
you saw your daughter Dora?</i>

18
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:16,140
<i>It was a horrible, horrible thing.</i>

19
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,135
We saw it on TV.

20
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:22,908
What we were in the clutches of.

21
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:26,143
And I prayed,
I prayed for that woman's family.

22
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:28,851
And it's me.

23
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:31,984
H's me.

24
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:36,726
- Mrs. Kelly, what about her father?
- Hmm.

25
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:40,058
Did they have a relationship?

26
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:42,155
Why? What have you heard?

27
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:45,164
I heard he passed. Is that correct?

28
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:48,503
Why wouldn't a father bathe his own child?

29
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:55,242
Ahem.

30
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:59,176
We, uh, were just wondering
how they got on, ma'am.

31
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:00,909
He died on the road.

32
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:04,420
He drove a Peterbilt,
and he took an exit too fast.

33
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:08,022
Rolled over near Rowan, Oklahoma.

34
00:04:09,516 --> 00:04:11,462
May 11th, 1984.

35
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:14,256
When was the last time you talked to her?

36
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:17,597
You know, she's always been
in some kind of trouble.

37
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:20,262
I thought things were getting better.

38
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,771
Got away from Charlie.

39
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:25,408
She came by not too long ago,
maybe a month.

40
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:30,542
She didn't talk about her daddy none.
Said shed been going to church.

41
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:34,712
Do you, um, do you remember
where that church was?

42
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,380
Oh...

43
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:37,979
- Mrs. Kelly?
- No.

44
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,280
Ow.

45
00:04:44,551 --> 00:04:47,054
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

46
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,225
Hail Mary, full of grace...

47
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,827
- Mrs. Kelly.
<i>- I...</i> I get these headaches.

48
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:55,599
It's like storms. Oh.

49
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,769
I worked in dry-cleaning for 20 years.

50
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:00,401
The chemicals.

51
00:05:01,568 --> 00:05:03,241
That's what's wrong with my nails.

52
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:12,980
<i>Piece of work, huh?</i>

53
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:16,119
<i>My mother, Donna Reed type.</i>

54
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,920
Packed lunches, bedtime stories.

55
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:26,434
Your mom still alive?

56
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:29,633
Maybe.

57
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:36,848
<i>Cohle ever talk about his parents?</i>

58
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:39,884
<i>No. Little bit. About his dad.</i>

59
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,019
<i>Alaska, 'Nam.</i>

60
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:46,390
You know, my dad,
I had about, uh, six inches on him,

61
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:51,721
and even in the end,
I still think he could have taken me.

62
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,397
Yeah. Marines, Korea.

63
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,168
Never talked about it.

64
00:05:57,224 --> 00:06:01,695
You know, there was a time that men
didn't air their bullshit to the world.

65
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:04,799
You know, it just wasn't
a part of their job.

66
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,737
Well, family.

67
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:12,310
Well, I mean, I...

68
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:14,709
I think a part of Rust's problem

69
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:18,688
was there was things he needed
that he couldn't admit to.

70
00:06:22,182 --> 00:06:23,718
Afternoon, men.

71

<i>So, we talked to
the victim's friend next, I believe.</i>

72

Miss Carla?

73
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:32,497
<i>I guess she always
had her mom's place,</i>

74
00:06:32,826 --> 00:06:36,501
but I thought maybe
she'd gotten into something, you know.

75
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:39,337
Like, uh, gaming, again.

76
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:42,676
Having a rough time.

77
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:45,012
What all did y'all talk about?

78
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:47,050
How was she?

79
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:49,849
Thin, loopy, like high.

80
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:52,256
She was on something.

81
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:54,916
She said she found a church,

82
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,090
but her eyes,

83
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:00,589
something wrong with them.

84
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:03,765
Now, do you remember
where this church was?

85
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:04,959
No.

86
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:09,405
You know
where she might have been staying?

87
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:12,033
Her landlord said
she'd moved out last summer.

88
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,044
That's when I stopped seeing her so much.

89
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:19,206
She mentioned someplace down south,
like around Spanish Lake.

90
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:25,248
A shelter, girls used to stay there,
something, all she said.

91
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:26,947
Hmm.

92
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,658
<i>She sounds sad, Many.</i>

93
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:33,625
Like a torn up person on her last legs.

94
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:38,630
She was just an easy target for him.

95
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:41,829
What do we know about him?

96
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:46,411
Hits prosts, artistic'
religious in some kind of way.

97
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:52,278
Every person within a thousand miles of here
is religious in some kind of way, except you.

98
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:54,114
How many DBs have antlers,

99
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:58,850
blindfolds, painted symbols
on their back, hmm?

100
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:01,088
Yeah, you know what tweakers get up to.

101
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:05,825
Shit, man, this dude in New Orleans
cut up his girl, felt remorse,

102
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,092
tried to piece her back together
with Krazy Glue.

103
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,929
That's just drug insanity.

104
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:12,467
That's not this. This has scope.

105
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:18,134
Now, she articulated a person with vision.
Vision is meaning. Meaning is historical.

106
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:22,543
Look, she was just chum in the water, man.

Hey, the other night,
when you were over for dinner,

119
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:45,195
why didn't you leave when I had Chris call?

120
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:55,101
Mmm, I don't know.
I guess I had sobered up a little.

121

Besides, it wasn't as bad as I thought.

122

Being around your family.
I liked talking to them.

Why'd you think that?

I'm just not good for people.

00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:41,396
Fifty-two minutes later,
back in her dorm room.

161
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:45,407
I got my uniform around my knees.

162
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:51,548
I'm occupied, so I don't hear anything.

163
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:57,381
I don't know that her roommate
has come home and snuck up behind us.

164
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:58,444
Oh, shit.

165
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:01,286
You know how I knew
that she was in the room?

166
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:03,725
She stuck her finger up my ass!

167
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,893
Ruined me. Now I can't do without it.

168
00:13:13,226 --> 00:13:16,639
<i>You miss some things on the job.
You know what I mean.</i>

169
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:21,134
You got to decompress before you can

170
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:24,112
go being a family man.

171
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:29,083
What you get into working,
you can't have the kids around that.

172
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:35,488
So, uh, sometimes you got
to get your head right.

173
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,155
Mind if I stop by?

174
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:40,530
<i>I don't know. Where are you?</i>

175
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:41,757
Elks.

176
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:45,096
- So you're drunk.
- No, I'm not.

177
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:48,135
I've hardly had anything to drink.

178
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:50,936
<i>You never hardly have anything to drink.</i>

179
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,043
I have a surprise for you.

180
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:57,676
- Oh, <i>yeah?</i>
- Yeah.

181
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:02,711
- Is that a yes?
- I, uh, <i>might</i> stay up.

182
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:04,777
Ah.

183
00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:11,152
<i>It's for your wife and kids, too.</i>

184
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:17,694
You got to take your release where
you find it or where it finds you.

185
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:22,169
I mean, in the end,
ifs for the good of the family.

186
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:44,226
What's that?

187
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:48,397
Oh, well, I, uh, got you a present.

188
00:15:06,773 --> 00:15:08,377
Don't move a muscle.

189
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:10,682
I shan't. Just the fingers.

190
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:13,853
The finger muscles.

191
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:15,549
<i>Mmm.</i>

192
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:18,259
Oh, stop.

193
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,696
- You're very naughty.
- Yes.

194
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,803
You have the right to remain silent.

195
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:35,436
Anything you say

196
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:38,948
can and will be held against you
in a court of law.

197
00:15:39,372 --> 00:15:41,784
You have the right to an attorney.

198
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:45,912
If you can't afford an attorney,
the State will provide you one.

199
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,884
Do you understand your rights?

200
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:52,988
You definitely have a career
in law enforcement.

201
00:15:56,222 --> 00:15:58,793
Well, I thought I was
gonna put these on you.

202
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:00,560
You want this?

203
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,064
Yeah?

204
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:03,907
You want it?

205
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,067
Yes.

206
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:37,132
<i>Mmm.</i>

207
00:16:48,641 --> 00:16:49,813
<i>Mmm.</i>

208
00:17:01,454 --> 00:17:05,493
<i>Now, what do you mean, exactly,
these visions you mentioned?</i>

209
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,998
<i>Oh, shit. [thought you knew.</i>

210
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:12,167
<i>I told Marty about them,
you know, down the line.</i>

211
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:23,151
<i>Uh, chemical flashbacks, neural damage,</i>

212
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:27,183
<i>you know, from my time in the HID TA,</i>

213
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:31,257
<i>as in "High intensity
Drug Trafficking Area."</i>

214
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:48,072
I spent four years undercover.

215
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:51,537
You know what that means?

216
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:56,842
That's where they got them Fed rumors,
I first come in.

217
00:17:59,512 --> 00:18:02,049
What, you two don't know about them?

218
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,290
Those files are still sealed, huh?

219
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:09,723
Shit.

220
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:14,797
Just what have you two heard about me?

221
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,597
You wanted Blues?

222
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:50,571
Quaaludes.

223
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:52,574
- Downers?
- Dopey stuff.

224
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:54,439
Oh.

225
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,501
What's it run?

226
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:59,242
I'm thinking Blue go for three a pill.

227
00:19:01,007 --> 00:19:03,453
Then we'll say 200 for the bottle.

228
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:11,861
I thought you might just take them.

229
00:19:15,788 --> 00:19:17,927
Or that you wanted something else.

230
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:22,498
Some kind of something else?

231
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:28,301
No.

232
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:35,845
Then I was thinking,
you're a good-looking man,

233
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:38,785
you wouldn't need a shakedown to get some.

234
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:44,288
What about rough trade? Scary guys'?
You girls talk.

235
00:19:45,985 --> 00:19:48,898
Around here, they're rough or whisky limp.

236
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:51,825
Seen plenty of guys that get touchy.

237
00:19:51,891 --> 00:19:55,304
Something sets them off
and they're like little boys.

238
00:19:56,162 --> 00:19:58,642
People always go away around here.

239
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:00,837
Where would I look?

240
00:20:02,468 --> 00:20:05,005
Working girls might know the blond?

241
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:09,213
If she was gaming I-10 south side,
I heard of this place.

242
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:11,718
Kind of trailer park.

243
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:14,186
Girls work and stay.

244
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:16,421
They call it "The Ranch."

245
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:17,992
Where's that?

246
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:21,327
Like, south of Spanish
Lake, supposed to be.

247
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:24,862
You know the place?

248
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:30,667
What's your deal?

249
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,009
I don't have a deal.

250
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:38,079
I mean, what do you do?

251
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:43,043
Never mind.
I thought you were gonna bust me.

252
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:46,750
I told you, I'm not interested.

253
00:20:46,846 --> 00:20:48,348
Yeah, I know.

254
00:20:50,116 --> 00:20:53,791
You're kind of strange,
like you might be dangerous.

255
00:20:53,953 --> 00:20:55,933
Well, of course I'm dangerous.

256
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:57,932
I'm police.

257
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,736
I can do terrible things to people

258
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:03,696
with impunity.

259
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:08,207
What'd you do last night?
I called up here late.

260
00:21:09,969 --> 00:21:11,039
What were you doing?

261
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:12,576
Working.

262
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:17,084
Was thinking about dropping by.
Where were you?

263
00:21:17,977 --> 00:21:19,650
I was out with girlfriends.

264
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:20,746
Uh-huh.

265
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,382
Well, I don't like that.

266
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:26,258
What, you're jealous?

267
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:29,057
Don't be stupid.

268
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:33,732
I just mean that there's
a crazy man out there,

269
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,831
and, uh, he's killing women.

270
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:40,400
Wait, you mean that girl again,
that Satanic thing?

271
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:43,913
Everyone's still talking about that
at the courthouse.

272
00:21:45,004 --> 00:21:46,244
It's not just her.

273
00:21:46,739 --> 00:21:48,241
There's more.

274
00:21:48,841 --> 00:21:50,650
There's more? Really?

275
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:56,119
Yeah, well, we're not saying,
keeping it out of the press,

276
00:21:57,683 --> 00:22:00,789
but we're thinking
that he's been doing this awhile.

277
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,321
Wow.

278
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:08,138
Yeah, so no need to go out.

279
00:22:08,194 --> 00:22:10,504
You just have a drink here.

280
00:22:11,964 --> 00:22:14,308
I can't meet a nice man at home.

281
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:23,947
That hurts me when you speak to me
in a passive-aggressive way.

282
00:22:25,611 --> 00:22:26,954
I always talk straight to you.

283
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:30,025
Excuse me. I meant that
since you're married,

284
00:22:30,216 --> 00:22:33,527
I need to be considering my options
as a young woman.

285
00:22:33,619 --> 00:22:35,462
I want things, Marty.

286
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:41,133
I want things, too.

287
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:45,232
Yeah, you just want your cake
and to eat it, too.

288
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:52,479
The hell good is cake if you can't eat it?

289
00:22:55,007 --> 00:22:56,315
<i>Mmm.</i>

290
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:06,824
Morning.

291
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:10,664
Hey, I think I might have
found something good.

292
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:14,000
Bunny ranch down south,
around Spanish Lake.

293
00:23:16,195 --> 00:23:18,573
I thought we were pulling old johns today.

294
00:23:18,664 --> 00:23:20,871
Yeah, we should do this first.

295
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:25,740
What?

296
00:23:26,005 --> 00:23:28,713
You wash up. You got some pussy on you.

297
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:34,513
Key to a healthy marriage.

298
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:36,522
Oh, that's Maggie, huh?

299
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:43,626
Hey. What's with your fucking nose?

300
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:46,601
Nothing, man. Sorry. Forget it.

301
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:52,600
I get a connotation being implied here
about my wife?

302
00:23:54,033 --> 00:23:56,809
Are you saying that's wife,
that high tide you're walking in with?

303
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:01,713
You got some idea
how my wife's pussy is supposed to smell?

304
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:07,246
No, I just meant you're wearing
the same clothes as you did yesterday,

305
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:10,423
coupled with the fact that I ain't stupid.

306
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:15,823
I wasn't making no comment
as to the particularity of the scent.

307
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:20,965
You don't say fuck-all about my wife.

308
00:24:21,727 --> 00:24:23,434
Don't say her name.

309
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:29,173
You got some self-loathing
to do this morning, that's fine,

310
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,240
but it ain't worth losing your hands over.

311
00:24:32,738 --> 00:24:35,150
And how would that work, exactly?

312
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:39,015
Well, I'd just apply
a couple pounds of pressure,

313
00:24:40,846 --> 00:24:42,484
snap your wrists.

314
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:46,329
You're senior detective.

315
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,490
Think I'm lying?

316
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:35,512
You got a specific location for this place

317
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:38,844
or are we just gonna wander around
till we find it?

318
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:40,474
I got some names.

319
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,746
I'm gonna have to ask for directions.

320
00:25:47,146 --> 00:25:49,524
Maybe you could just follow your nose.

321
00:25:52,985 --> 00:25:55,158
<i>Wherever he picked them up,</i>

322
00:25:55,687 --> 00:25:59,362
I mean, I won't lie, however we left it,

323
00:25:59,825 --> 00:26:01,498
he had some moves.

324
00:26:03,996 --> 00:26:06,670
<i>He knew a few Cls from his name days.</i>

325
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:09,179
<i>They knew these pads,</i>

326
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:12,909
<i>put us in touch with some names,
people to talk to.</i>

327
00:26:14,006 --> 00:26:15,110
How we doing, boys?

328
00:26:15,207 --> 00:26:16,447
- Hey.
- Hello.

329
00:26:16,542 --> 00:26:21,184
We're looking for a little bunny ranch
down around these parts.

330
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:24,588
- Y'all know where we could find it?
- No, sir.

331
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:27,425
- Never heard about it? Little whorehouse?
- Nuh-uh.

332
00:26:27,853 --> 00:26:28,853
Sorry, man.

333
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:31,265
Supposed to be stuck up in the woods
around here?

334
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:32,596
<i>I'll tell you this,</i>

335
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:36,764
<i>Rust had about as sharp an eye for weakness
as I ever seen.</i>

336
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:45,810
I'll be right back.

337
00:26:53,412 --> 00:26:54,948
It's my bad, boys.

338
00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:57,584
Maybe we got started on
the wrong foot there.

339
00:26:57,649 --> 00:26:58,650
Aah!

340
00:27:02,588 --> 00:27:03,965
Aah!

341
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:07,263
You remember
where that little whorehouse is?

342
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:25,319
Take 353 south.

343
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:27,754
Gotta exit off the shoulder
before we get to the 14.

344
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:31,454
From there, we take a din fishing road
to Bayou Chenault.

345
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:34,589
Okay.

346
00:28:11,557 --> 00:28:12,797
HART; That it?

347
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,467
Mmm-hmm.

348
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:32,178
Cop car, y'all.

349
00:28:33,312 --> 00:28:35,690
Whose turn is it for the freebie?

350
00:28:46,758 --> 00:28:49,932
I don't do no cops.
That's on you guys, remember'?

351
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:52,998
Hello, ma'am.

352
00:28:53,699 --> 00:28:57,044
Martin Han, Rustin Cohle. State CID.

353
00:28:59,171 --> 00:29:00,775
This your place?

354
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,075
It's my lease.

355
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:06,118
What is this,
some kind of hillbilly bunny ranch?

356
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:07,554
Excuse me?

357
00:29:07,713 --> 00:29:11,684
You might want to talk to Sheriff Biison
before you start tossing accusations around.

358
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:13,761
No, I got nothing against hillbillies.

359
00:29:14,286 --> 00:29:16,926
Relax.
That's not why we're here. We, uh...

360
00:29:17,022 --> 00:29:21,801
Well' something happened lo a girl,
and we need to know if any of you knew her.

361
00:29:28,734 --> 00:29:30,407
Yeah. That's Dori.

362
00:29:32,404 --> 00:29:33,439
Something happened?

363
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:36,546
You know about that woman
found outside of Erath?

364
00:29:39,044 --> 00:29:40,216
Oh, no.

365
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,320
Did something happen to Dori?

366
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:49,899
Were you pretty
good friends with her?

367
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:52,902
She was nice to me when
I first came around.

368
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:55,769
Gave me tips and stuff.

369
00:29:57,296 --> 00:29:59,469
Tips? About what?

370
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:07,573
Nothing. You know, just how to be.

371
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:17,420
You got any idea where she might
have been staying the last few weeks?

372
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:19,690
I don't.

373
00:30:21,086 --> 00:30:22,861
Her ex is in prison.

374
00:30:23,588 --> 00:30:26,034
I guess maybe she got a new place.

375
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:29,464
She'd been going to church.

376
00:30:30,095 --> 00:30:33,269
I was hoping
maybe she just turned things around.

377
00:30:36,268 --> 00:30:39,181
We're gonna need to question
any girls might have known her.

378
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,943
That's a tougher ask than you think.

379
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:46,454
Folks'll be staying away,
they hear y'all are out here.

380
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:49,720
Well, ma'am,
it's the best way to get us to leave.

381
00:30:53,285 --> 00:30:56,630
- You said she left a bag?
- Yeah.

382
00:30:57,456 --> 00:30:58,901
Can I see it?

383
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:06,067
Sure.

384
00:31:16,475 --> 00:31:18,182
That girl's not 18.

385
00:31:19,411 --> 00:31:22,153
Sheriff know you got underage working here?

386
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:25,385
What do you know
about where that girl's been?

387
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:27,391
Where she come from?

388
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:29,654
You want to know Beth's situation,

389
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:31,831
before she ran out on her uncle?

390
00:31:33,692 --> 00:31:36,229
There are other places she could go.

391
00:31:37,162 --> 00:31:39,938
Such holy bullshit from you.

392
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:43,340
It's a woman's body, ain't it?

393
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:44,873
A woman's choice.

394
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:47,878
Well, she don't look like a woman to me.

395
00:31:48,707 --> 00:31:52,621
At that age, she is not equipped
to make those kind of choices.

396
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:57,386
But I guess you don't give a shit
what kind of damage she's doing to herself

397
00:31:57,449 --> 00:31:58,928
as long <i>as</i> you're making your money.

398
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:03,227
Girls walk this earth all the time
screwing for free.

399
00:32:04,189 --> 00:32:08,467
Now, why is it you add business to the mix,
and boys like you can't stand the thought?

400
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,062
I'll tell you.

401
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:15,035
It's 'cause suddenly you don't own it
the way you thought you did.

402
00:32:18,737 --> 00:32:19,875
Ahem.

403
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:25,921
Ma'am, you've both
been very helpful.

404
00:32:26,211 --> 00:32:27,588
We'll be in touch.

405
00:32:28,213 --> 00:32:31,820
Yes, thank you for your help.

406
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:44,734
Do something else.

407
00:32:58,477 --> 00:32:59,615
That a down payment?

408
00:33:02,247 --> 00:33:06,923
Is shitting on any moment of decency
part of your job description?

409
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:15,939
"I closed my eyes and saw The King in
Yellow moving through the forest."

410
00:33:17,696 --> 00:33:19,698
This is her diary, Marty.

411
00:33:19,865 --> 00:33:22,607
Believe this shit? A girl that young?

412
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:27,605
You know the sheriff has got a stake
in this place, too.

413
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:29,208
Fucking Christ.

414
00:33:29,608 --> 00:33:31,986
"The King's children were marked.

415
00:33:32,277 --> 00:33:34,223
"They became his angels."

416
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:43,799
The Yellow King, Carcosa.

417
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:45,963
Nut job.

418
00:33:47,626 --> 00:33:49,572
Fried her brain on whatever she was on.

419
00:33:49,661 --> 00:33:52,574
Sounds like she didn't have much
to begin with.

420
00:33:52,664 --> 00:33:54,905
Well, it reads like fantasy.

421
00:33:57,302 --> 00:33:59,714
What if he was dosing her regular,

422
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:04,651
and over a period of time, upping the dose
little by little without her knowing?

423
00:34:05,477 --> 00:34:10,756
We should stay out here today,
check around for johns, maybe knew her.

424
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:13,428
Look at this.

425
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:19,561
Oh, yeah. Man, a lot of these type places.

426
00:34:20,191 --> 00:34:22,728
Expect the ﬂock to canvass for them.

427
00:34:24,095 --> 00:34:27,235
You know, we should go there.
Could be the church everyone mentioned.

428
00:34:27,332 --> 00:34:30,108
Well, let's check around for johns
while we're out here

429
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:32,511
and pick up the church on Monday.

430
00:34:35,674 --> 00:34:38,211
<i>Most of your
stuffs still redacted.</i>

431
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,383
<i>Now, what's Northshore?</i>

432
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:45,551
Northshore Psychiatric Hospital.

433
00:34:46,518 --> 00:34:50,193
Lubbock, Texas.
I spent four months there in '93.

434
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:53,233
- You feel like talking about that?
- Well, sure.

435
00:34:54,059 --> 00:34:55,697
Who gives a shit?

436
00:35:00,699 --> 00:35:07,480
Sofia, my daughter,
she was on her tricycle in our driveway.

437
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:08,944
Um...

438
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:18,717
We lived on... We were in a
little bend in the road, and...

439
00:35:21,386 --> 00:35:23,059
They said that...

440
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:30,069
Anyway, afterwards, uh,

441
00:35:31,763 --> 00:35:34,744
Claire and I turned on
each other, you know.

442
00:35:35,567 --> 00:35:38,810
We... We resented each other
for being alive, you know.

443
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:47,583
I transferred from Robbery to Narco.

444
00:35:49,414 --> 00:35:51,917
Started hitting it, you know, 2417.

445
00:35:52,684 --> 00:35:54,686
Street rips, knocking down doors.

446
00:35:54,786 --> 00:35:58,165
Within three months I was
ripping off couriers

447
00:35:58,256 --> 00:36:02,295
or ending up in a Ramada Inn
with a couple of fucking eight-balls.

448
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,768
Oh, yeah.

449
00:36:07,265 --> 00:36:09,609
Somewhere in there Claire left,

450
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:15,049
and somewhere in there
I emptied a .9 into a crankhead

451
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:18,280
for injecting his infant
daughter with crystal.

452
00:36:19,944 --> 00:36:22,322
Said he was trying to purify her.

453
00:36:24,816 --> 00:36:27,695
State Attorney gave me one chance
to stay out of jail.

454
00:36:27,786 --> 00:36:32,633
He said, "You can keep your profile,
but we wanna make you our wildman junkie."

455
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:36,297
So they did.
They made me a floater, like a trick.

456
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:40,468
You know, any agency or department
needed a deep undercover narco,

457
00:36:40,632 --> 00:36:42,009
they got me.

458
00:36:42,067 --> 00:36:45,139
And there was no fucking expiration date,
baby.

459
00:36:46,171 --> 00:36:48,981
And they kept you out there for four years?

460
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,417
Mmm-hmm.

461
00:36:50,508 --> 00:36:55,719
In February of '93, I killed three
cartel men at the Port of Houston.

462
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:59,753
I took three .25s in the side

463
00:36:59,851 --> 00:37:03,924
and ended up at Northshore
Psychiatric Hospital in Lubbock, Texas.

464
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:07,435
Which is kind of funny in its own right.

465
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:10,028
Psych ward being in Lubbock' Texas.

466
00:37:10,195 --> 00:37:12,004
You ever been there?

467
00:37:12,263 --> 00:37:14,607
They offered me a psych pension.

468
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:16,535
Jackpot, right?

469
00:37:17,335 --> 00:37:21,181
I said no.
I said, "Put me on Homicide somewhere."

470
00:37:21,873 --> 00:37:24,581
By then, I was owed quite a few favors,

471
00:37:24,876 --> 00:37:27,914
and, uh, Louisiana was what they had.

472
00:37:33,218 --> 00:37:36,791
<i>Yeah, for a long time after,</i> I...
<i>I didn't really sleep.</i>

473
00:37:38,456 --> 00:37:42,370
<i>Nightmares, PTSD,
exhausted nerves, whatever.</i>

474
00:38:15,927 --> 00:38:17,065
Yeah.

475
00:38:19,898 --> 00:38:21,343
Why Homicide?

476
00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:25,675
Oh, something I saw at Northshore.

477
00:38:27,338 --> 00:38:29,249
Quote from Corinthians.

478
00:38:33,111 --> 00:38:37,082
"The body is not one member, but many.

479
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:41,759
"Now are they many,

480
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,994
"but of one body."

481
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:47,763
What's that mean, though?

482
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:52,304
I was just trying to stay
a part of the body now.

483
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:55,769
The fishing pole's not working.

484
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:57,836
- Just ask Grandpa.
- No.

485
00:38:58,536 --> 00:39:01,142
- Yeah.
- Grandpa, I can't tell if it's working.

486
00:39:01,206 --> 00:39:04,119
You'll know, honey. It'll yank at you hard.

487
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:06,820
- Okay.
- Why don't you...

488
00:39:06,878 --> 00:39:09,381
How's that case going? The big one?

489
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:13,725
Working it, you know.

490
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:19,294
Things like that didn't happen these pans
when I was young.

491
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,894
People said "ma'am" and "sir"

492
00:39:21,993 --> 00:39:23,995
Families stayed together.

493
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:27,471
Yeah, that's how it was, huh?

494
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,473
Not all the time.

495
00:39:31,169 --> 00:39:33,046
There was more dignity.

496
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:36,983
Everyone wasn't out in the street,
yelling about their rights.

497
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:42,490
Well, if things were so great,
they never would have changed.

498
00:39:42,981 --> 00:39:43,982
Hmm.

499
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:45,550
Nothing is going on.

500
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:48,995
I'm just saying, if there's a problem,
you can talk to me. You know that.

501
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:51,556
If I have a problem with someone,
I talk to them, Ma.

502
00:39:51,656 --> 00:39:53,727
Well, you should be able lo talk to me.

503
00:39:53,825 --> 00:39:56,829
I know what it's like
to be married to a man.

504
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,041
You think they're all the <i>same,</i> huh?

505
00:39:59,864 --> 00:40:03,334
I don't know why you're so rude to me. If
you're frustrated, don't take it out on me.

506
00:40:04,102 --> 00:40:06,241
I think that you need
to get your cable fixed

507
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:08,715
and stop confusing me
with your soap operas.

508
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:11,185
Well, you beat up on
what you can't control.

509
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:13,847
Makes it bad for everybody else.

510
00:40:14,345 --> 00:40:16,586
- I don't know how.
- I don't care. Just try.

511
00:40:16,681 --> 00:40:18,524
- You do it.
- I can't.

512
00:40:19,017 --> 00:40:20,553
You have smaller fingers.

513
00:40:20,618 --> 00:40:22,291
Macie, just do it.

514
00:40:24,522 --> 00:40:27,264
So, you're telling me
the world isn't getting worse?

515
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:32,706
I've seen kids today, all in black,
wearing makeup, shit on their faces.

516
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,735
Even/thing's sex.

517
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:36,540
Clinton.

518
00:40:38,036 --> 00:40:40,107
You know, throughout history,

519
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:43,378
I bet every old man
probably said the same thing.

520
00:40:43,808 --> 00:40:46,812
And old men die,
and the world keeps spinning.

521
00:40:50,048 --> 00:40:52,654
- Honey, I got this lead...
- How are the girls?

522
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:57,096
I got this lead I wanted to check up on.
I told you about it.

523
00:40:57,722 --> 00:41:02,137
- Maybe your dad could bring you back.
- No. You didn't tell me anything about it.

524
00:41:02,226 --> 00:41:04,069
This is a family day.

525
00:41:04,729 --> 00:41:07,232
I did tell you about it. I mentioned it.

526
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,972
It's the new case.

527
00:41:14,272 --> 00:41:16,479
Okay, well, how about
we all head back, then?

528
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:19,316
Hmm. All right, sweetheart.

529
00:41:20,244 --> 00:41:21,814
Come on! Let's go!

530
00:41:21,913 --> 00:41:23,586
Our lines tangled.

531
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:25,658
- Just paddle in.
- Okay.

532
00:41:26,184 --> 00:41:27,288
Told you!

533
00:41:28,186 --> 00:41:30,530
- Thanks for the lovely afternoon.
- Oh.

534
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:34,634
Thank you.

535
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:01,519
Afternoon, sir.

536
00:42:01,953 --> 00:42:04,559
- How you doing today, Officer'?
- I have a question for you.

537
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:06,635
You ever seen this girl?

538
00:42:06,958 --> 00:42:09,234
- You never seen her before?
- Never before.

539
00:42:09,327 --> 00:42:10,362
<i>How about you?</i>

540
00:42:36,654 --> 00:42:37,894
Question.

541
00:42:37,989 --> 00:42:40,401
I'm looking for this young lady.
Do you recognize her?

542
00:42:41,692 --> 00:42:43,433
I might need a memory jog.

543
00:42:43,728 --> 00:42:45,708
Dora. Young blonde?

544
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:48,503
Dora. Dora, Dora, Dora, Dora.

545
00:42:49,167 --> 00:42:50,168
Dora.

546
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:54,276
Have any guys come around lately
looking for anything more than a good time?

547
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:57,113
You might be able to remember
for a little more money?

548
00:42:57,208 --> 00:42:59,017
- I might.
- You might?

549
00:43:07,618 --> 00:43:10,360
Years, we've been through this.

550
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:15,268
Sweetheart, listen to me.
There is nowhere else I want to be.

551
00:43:17,295 --> 00:43:18,856
I wonder if you even know you're lying.

552
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:20,636
Oh, come on!

553
00:43:20,731 --> 00:43:21,732
Shh.

554
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:27,606
Bad enough the shit I got to wade through
on a daily basis,

555
00:43:27,705 --> 00:43:30,049
bring me this "feel bad for me" crap

556
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,884
when I work 30 hours straight

557
00:43:32,977 --> 00:43:36,550
and spent the weekend
listening to your dad's bullshit.

558
00:43:37,048 --> 00:43:42,498
I come home, the one place where
there's supposed to be peace and calm,

559
00:43:42,587 --> 00:43:44,507
- and you throw this shit...
- Who told you that?

560
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:48,002
It's not always that way.
It's not supposed to be.

561
00:43:48,092 --> 00:43:51,232
It's supposed to be what I want.
It's supposed to help me.

562
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:54,276
We do help you! All the goddamn time!

563
00:43:58,569 --> 00:44:01,140
Okay, well, what do you want me to say?

564
00:44:01,239 --> 00:44:04,777
You want me to talk about the woman,
had antlers?

565
00:44:04,842 --> 00:44:07,652
Do you want me to tell you
about the kids disappearing,

566
00:44:07,745 --> 00:44:11,625
and maybe you'll stop
with the "poor me" little whiny bullshit?

567
00:44:13,584 --> 00:44:15,689
Is that what you're saying, hmm?

568
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,930
That I'm trying to make
you feel bad for me?

569
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:21,964
Is that really how you want to play this?

570
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:23,998
No, honey.

571
00:44:24,095 --> 00:44:27,338
I think you're the
greatest woman I ever met,

572
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:30,445
and you're the greatest thing
that ever happened to me.

573
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:32,981
But, yeah, you know, sometimes

574
00:44:33,471 --> 00:44:37,977
I think you might have a penchant
for self-pity.

575
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:42,522
And right now I need you to be strong
so that I can do my job.

576
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:48,827
You have developed
some sort of selective deafness.

577
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:52,360
You used to not be such a chicken shit,
I swear.

578
00:44:56,961 --> 00:44:59,134
Even your mom thinks you're a ball-buster.

579
00:45:09,073 --> 00:45:10,984
Tell the girls, dinner.

580
00:45:17,048 --> 00:45:18,493
<i>Mmm.</i>

581
00:45:25,089 --> 00:45:27,831
You don't have
a mommy or daddy anymore.

582
00:45:28,025 --> 00:45:30,335
Yeah, they just died in an accident.

583
00:45:31,362 --> 00:45:32,432
How?

584
00:45:32,863 --> 00:45:35,002
In a car accident. Someone...

585
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:37,603
Dinner-time, kids. Go to the kitchen.

586
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:39,938
Are you coming?

587
00:45:40,371 --> 00:45:42,681
- Yeah, of course. I'm starving.
- Really?

588
00:45:43,374 --> 00:45:44,853
Yeah, really.

589
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:46,413
Good.

590
00:46:00,725 --> 00:46:03,467
<i>You know,
I think about my daughter now.</i>

591
00:46:05,363 --> 00:46:06,740
And what...

592
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:10,041
What she was spared.

593
00:46:13,704 --> 00:46:15,741
Sometimes I feel grateful.

594
00:46:21,712 --> 00:46:27,458
Doctors said she didn't feel a thing,
went straight into a coma.

595
00:46:29,387 --> 00:46:31,492
And then, somewhere in that

596
00:46:32,823 --> 00:46:35,565
blackness, she slipped off into another

597
00:46:37,061 --> 00:46:38,472
deeper kind.

598
00:46:44,235 --> 00:46:46,841
Isn't that a beautiful way to go out?

599
00:46:49,407 --> 00:46:50,784
Painlessly.

600
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:54,014
As a happy child.

601
00:46:56,347 --> 00:46:57,621
Hmm.

602
00:47:01,085 --> 00:47:05,534
Yeah, trouble with dying later
is you've already grown up.

603
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:08,766
Damage is done. It's too late.

604
00:47:10,795 --> 00:47:12,035
You got kids?

605
00:47:13,998 --> 00:47:14,999
<i>Mmm.</i>

606
00:47:17,535 --> 00:47:21,950
I think of the hubris it must take to

607
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:29,283
yank a soul out of nonexistence
into this meat.

608
00:47:31,982 --> 00:47:35,691
And to force a life into this thresher.

609
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:42,634
And as for my daughter, she, uh...

610
00:47:44,729 --> 00:47:48,905
she spared me the sin of being a father.

611
00:47:50,468 --> 00:47:53,347
Hi, Cathleen, you little vixen.

612
00:47:54,505 --> 00:47:57,145
- Any chance of some coffee?
- Of course.

613
00:47:57,341 --> 00:47:58,479
Okay

614
00:47:58,843 --> 00:48:00,481
Who are these guys?

615
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:02,683
Some assholes Quesada brought in.

616
00:48:02,747 --> 00:48:04,317
Coffee on its way.

617
00:48:04,382 --> 00:48:05,918
- Hey, morning, Marty.
- Hey.

618
00:48:06,016 --> 00:48:08,826
Major's introducing me
to the new ﬂying squad.

619
00:48:09,353 --> 00:48:11,993
You know Mark Daughtry, Ted Bertrand.

620
00:48:12,356 --> 00:48:13,664
Daughtry-

621
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:14,759
Ted.

622
00:48:14,859 --> 00:48:17,100
- Jimmy Dufrene.
- Jimmy Dufrene.

623
00:48:17,595 --> 00:48:18,938
What's up?

624
00:48:19,163 --> 00:48:22,576
We've been tasked with investigating crimes
with possible occult links.

625
00:48:22,666 --> 00:48:26,239
There's been a rash of animal mutilations,
cemeteries defiled.

626
00:48:26,337 --> 00:48:28,078
And they want to see
what we have on the Lange case.

627
00:48:28,172 --> 00:48:29,207
Uh-huh.

628
00:48:29,273 --> 00:48:33,380
Well, this task force is important to
the commander and to the governor's office.

629
00:48:33,444 --> 00:48:36,186
You know' a lot of people
are concerned about it.

630
00:48:36,414 --> 00:48:38,189
You know, me, I don't see the connection

631
00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:41,093
between two dead cats
and a murdered woman.

632
00:48:41,952 --> 00:48:43,260
But then, I'm from Texas.

633
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:47,601
We're not stepping on your toes, Marty.

634
00:48:47,691 --> 00:48:50,433
We just got the mandate.
We got to compare notes with what you got.

635
00:48:50,528 --> 00:48:51,598
Yeah.

636
00:48:51,695 --> 00:48:53,766
- Here you are, Detective.
- No. Thanks, Cathleen.

637
00:48:53,864 --> 00:48:54,934
You got it.

638
00:48:55,032 --> 00:48:56,033
Xerox all you want.

639
00:48:57,701 --> 00:48:59,908
Make you feel like good oops.

640
00:49:08,245 --> 00:49:09,986
You mo, my office.

641
00:49:12,716 --> 00:49:15,890
<i>Cohle, we got</i> a <i>new rule
around here, especially for you.</i>

642
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:20,225
You got an opinion about anything,
you hold on to it.

643
00:49:21,091 --> 00:49:26,131
You hold on to it or you tell it to Marty.
Otherwise, button your big, fat mouth.

644
00:49:27,231 --> 00:49:29,643
However smart you are,
you're not as smart <i>as</i> you think.

645
00:49:29,733 --> 00:49:31,406
Are you serious, boss?

646
00:49:32,937 --> 00:49:37,147
This God-bothering shit, it's a
political circle-jerk. You know this.

647
00:49:37,241 --> 00:49:39,243
Is this a place you live?

648
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:41,412
Where are you, huh?

649
00:49:41,779 --> 00:49:45,420
You had anything in the last weeks?
You got a suspect?

650
00:49:45,483 --> 00:49:48,657
Give us some more guys
to follow up KAs, track records.

651
00:49:48,752 --> 00:49:52,256
No, our bosses don't want you at all,
you understand?

652
00:49:52,323 --> 00:49:53,961
I don't want you.

653
00:49:54,258 --> 00:49:57,933
You are upright
only by the grace of this man's reputation.

654
00:49:58,295 --> 00:49:59,433
Goddamn, Cohle.

655
00:49:59,497 --> 00:50:02,706
How many ways are there for me to say,
"Shut the fuck up"?

656
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:07,975
I mean, we work under command, right?

657
00:50:08,472 --> 00:50:12,318
Now, our betters want
a public, high-profile show of response.

658
00:50:13,511 --> 00:50:18,483
Shit, I got a state senator, he's trying
to label Satanic graffiti <i>as</i> a hate crime.

659
00:50:18,549 --> 00:50:21,530
That has nothing to do with our DB,
and that's the fact of it.

660
00:50:21,619 --> 00:50:24,862
Okay, okay. Fine.
Let's say that's true, all right?

661
00:50:25,523 --> 00:50:28,993
Let's say that you guys
get the case all to yourselves.

662
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:31,867
You ever solve a murder
been in the red more than a week?

663
00:50:32,129 --> 00:50:33,199
You ever clear one

664
00:50:33,297 --> 00:50:35,743
where two rounds of questions
didn't hand you the fucking answer?

665
00:50:35,833 --> 00:50:38,404
- Oh, come on.
- No, no, you got leads' you got a timeline.

666
00:50:38,502 --> 00:50:39,708
You know what I got?

667
00:50:39,803 --> 00:50:42,875
I got a whodunit,
where my two detectives are stalling,

668
00:50:42,973 --> 00:50:46,147
and I got a brand-new task force
wants to take it off our hands.

669
00:50:46,377 --> 00:50:49,358
- We have a lead, boss.
- Oh, for Christ's sake. Fuck off, Cohle.

670
00:50:53,484 --> 00:50:54,656
Christ.

671
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:58,056
It's your call.

672
00:50:59,156 --> 00:51:00,726
You want to dump this one off?

673
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:04,200
You ought to think about it,
given the spotlight.

674
00:51:04,261 --> 00:51:07,902
You know, Teddy Bertrand's a
good detective. You know him.

675
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:13,006
Well, you're a smartass
with your mouth shut.

676
00:51:14,338 --> 00:51:17,251
I was just gonna say
we've got a lead on a church.

677
00:51:17,341 --> 00:51:19,912
Our vic was spending a lot of time there.

678
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:22,581
That's where we were headed.
It could be the break we need.

679
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:27,789
Inside, whatever they're putting over you,
how much more time could you get us?

680
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:29,446
Right now, it's up for discussion.

681
00:51:29,453 --> 00:51:32,866
But, you know,
Tutile's lighting a fire under this.

682
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:34,596
Without a suspect,

683
00:51:35,192 --> 00:51:38,867
they're just gonna stop asking questions,
Marty, and they're gonna give orders.

684
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:40,374
That's that.

685
00:51:41,231 --> 00:51:43,370
Give us the rest of the month

686
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:47,280
before they lump it into whatever the
play is with the task force, yeah?

687
00:51:50,207 --> 00:51:51,447
Ru try.

688
00:51:52,476 --> 00:51:54,956
Two weeks,
and then you two start catching again.

689
00:51:55,045 --> 00:51:56,115
Yeah.

690
00:51:59,917 --> 00:52:01,157
<i>Let's cut to the point.</i>

691
00:52:01,385 --> 00:52:02,830
As the crow ﬂies,

692
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:07,232
y'all are wanting to ask about
that big throw-down in the woods, yeah?

693
00:52:07,758 --> 00:52:10,796
Eventually, sure. Right now, we're
just trying to track the case.

694
00:52:10,894 --> 00:52:13,135
How Cohle worked it, especially.

695
00:52:16,233 --> 00:52:19,442
Which indicates
you think I'm too thick to realize

696
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:22,780
that y'all are trying to jam somebody up.

697
00:52:23,674 --> 00:52:25,779
You're on to something new.

698
00:52:28,412 --> 00:52:31,086
So Cohle didn't want to give it
to the task force.

699
00:52:31,915 --> 00:52:33,019
Did you?

700
00:52:37,621 --> 00:52:40,124
No, I did not.

701
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:53,372
It don't make sense.
There is nothing out here.

702
00:52:55,773 --> 00:52:59,482
According to this map,
it should be within these few miles.

703
00:53:03,447 --> 00:53:08,624
Well, ahem, I guess if it's one of those
tent revival places, they move around.

704
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:10,724
Yeah.

705
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:13,160
Tents usually do.

706
00:53:15,693 --> 00:53:18,799
There's no date on this flyer,
which is strange.

707
00:53:24,902 --> 00:53:26,142
There's something up there.

708
00:54:14,752 --> 00:54:18,723
<i>Wait, wait, back up.
Are you saying you hallucinated on the job?</i>

709
00:54:18,789 --> 00:54:19,790
<i>Mmm.</i>

710
00:54:20,591 --> 00:54:24,698
No. I mean, I could always tell what
was real or what wasn't, you know.

711
00:54:24,762 --> 00:54:28,232
So when I'd see things,
fuck, man, I'd just roll with it.

712
00:54:29,133 --> 00:54:30,544
You still see things?

713
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:33,304
No.

714
00:54:35,906 --> 00:54:40,821
No, they stopped altogether
after I was clean a couple years.

715
00:54:41,779 --> 00:54:43,781
No numbers on this place.

716
00:54:45,582 --> 00:54:48,324
Fire must have happened a long time ago.

717
00:55:21,084 --> 00:55:23,655
Okay. Place is trashed.

718
00:55:25,255 --> 00:55:27,428
This ain't no kind of anything.

719
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:34,772
<i>Yeah, back then, the visions.</i>

720
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:40,309
<i>Yeah, most of the time,
I was convinced, shit, Yd lost it.</i>

721
00:55:42,372 --> 00:55:43,544
Marty.

722
00:55:58,655 --> 00:56:00,862
<i>But there were other times,</i>

723
00:56:07,464 --> 00:56:11,469
<i>I thought I was mainlining
the secret truth of the universe.</i>
